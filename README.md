# CDS-102: Lab 1 â€” Reproducible research with RMarkdown and Github

**Due:** May 25, 2018 \@ 11:59pm

> This first lab will serve as a general introduction to the major tools and platforms that we will be using throughout the semester, which are R, RStudio, and Git/Github.
> R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface, and both are installed on the lab computers.
> For this first lab, we request that you login to the RStudio Server <https://rstudio.cos.gmu.edu>, as installing and setting up everything takes some time.
